# Final Project

## Setup
Create a virtual environment using virtualenv (make sure to use a python version >= 3.10) and run the following commands after activating your virtual env.

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -e .
```

### If using vscode and your editor shows is not able to find the project dependencies
Follow the instructions [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/environments#_working-with-python-interpreters) to change the python interpreter used by the editor. Make sure you select the interpreter of the virtual environment you created when installing the project.

### Before you push changes to the remote repo make sure 

1. You are not adding unnecessary dependencies to the project. 
2. `requirements.txt` file is up to date.
3. Everything works.
